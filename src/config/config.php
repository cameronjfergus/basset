    | Basset needs to know what your production environment is so that it can
    | respond with the correct assets. When in production Basset will attempt
    | to return any built collections. If a collection has not been built
    | Basset will dynamically route to each asset in the collection and apply
    | the filters.
    |
    | The last method can be very taxing so it's highly recommended that
    | collections are built when deploying to a production environment.
    |
    | You can supply an array of production environment names if you need to.

    | Asset and Filter Aliases
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | You can define aliases for commonly used assets or filters.
    | An example of an asset alias:
    |
    |   'layout' => 'stylesheets/layout/master.css'
    |
    | Filter aliases are slightly different. You can define a simple alias
    | similar to an asset alias.
    |
    |   'YuiCss' => 'Yui\CssCompressorFilter'
    |
    | However if you want to pass in options to an aliased filter then define
    | the alias as a nested array. The key should be the filter and the value
    | should be a callback closure where you can set arguments for a filters
    | constructor, etc.
    |
    |   'YuiCss' => array(
    |       'Yui\CssCompressorFilter' => function($filter)
    |       {
    |           $filter->setArguments('path/to/jar');
    |       }
    |   )
